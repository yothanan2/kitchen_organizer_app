# Project Handoff: Kitchen Organizer

## Session Summary

This session focused on a major refactor of the Mise en Place system and fixing a critical repository issue.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Mise en Place Refactor (Master List Model):**
    *   **Admin Management:** Created a new "Mise en Place Management" screen (`lib/screens/admin/mise_en_place_management_screen.dart`) allowing admins to globally activate or deactivate any `Component`.
    *   **Kitchen Checklist:** Reworked the kitchen's `MiseEnPlaceScreen` (`lib/screens/kitchen/mise_en_place_screen.dart`) to display a simple, unified checklist of all globally active components, replacing the old dish-based generation model.
    *   **Data Model & Logic:** Updated the `PrepTask` model and the `MiseEnPlaceController` to use a simple boolean `isCompleted` status, moving away from the previous quantity-based tracking system. A new `masterMiseEnPlaceProvider` was created to drive this new logic.

2.  **Repository & Git Fixes:**
    *   **`git push` Failure:** Diagnosed that the `git push` command was failing due to a timeout caused by an excessively large repository size (over 400 MiB).
    *   **.gitignore Update:** Corrected the `.gitignore` file to properly exclude large, generated directories such as `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, and `.idea/`.
    *   **Repository Cleanup:** Removed the previously committed large directories from the Git index using `git rm --cached`. This has prepared the repository for a much smaller and successful push.

## Next Steps & Open Tasks

1.  **Manual Git Commit (CRITICAL):**
    *   My environment is unable to execute `git commit` commands. All the necessary files for the repository cleanup **have been staged**.
    *   **Immediate next action:** You need to run the following command in your terminal to finalize the cleanup:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "chore: Clean up .gitignore and remove large files"
        ```
    *   After committing, the `git push` command should now succeed.

2.  **Connect Inventory to New Mise en Place:**
    *   The new checklist successfully marks tasks as complete, but it is not yet connected to the inventory system.
    *   The next development task is to update the `MiseEnPlaceController` so that when a task is checked off, the ingredients listed in that component's recipe are automatically deducted from the central inventory.

3.  **Verify the "Connected Loop":**
    *   Once inventory consumption is linked, we must verify that the rest of the automated workflow is triggered correctly (i.e., low-stock alerts and daily ordering suggestions).

4.  **Continue Admin Dashboard Development:**
    *   With the core Mise en Place workflow updated, development can continue on other features for the admin dashboard as outlined in the main `GEMINI.md` project file.
