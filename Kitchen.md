# Project Handoff: Kitchen Organizer

## Session Summary

This session was a major success. We completed the full refactor of the Mise en Place system, moving it to a more intuitive, station-based workflow. We also resolved several deep-seated bugs related to data integrity, state management, and UI layout.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Mise en Place Refactor (Complete):**
    *   **Station-Based Workflow:** The Mise en Place screen now correctly displays tasks grouped into tabs for "Front", "Hot", and "Back" stations.
    *   **Dish-Component Nesting:** Within each station tab, components (prep tasks) are now logically nested under the parent dish they belong to, providing clear context for the kitchen staff.
    *   **Admin Control:** Admins can now assign any component to a specific station.

2.  **Critical Bug Fixes:**
    *   **Data Integrity:** Implemented robust, server-side Firestore rules to prevent inventory from ever falling below zero. The client-side logic was also improved to provide clear error messages.
    *   **State Management:** Fixed a frustrating bug in the "Add/Edit Component" screen that caused form data to be lost, improving the admin workflow.
    *   **Layout Overflow:** Permanently fixed the `RenderFlex` overflow bug on the `InventoryOverviewScreen` by restructuring the layout for a more robust display.
    *   **Deletion Logic:** Temporarily disabled the component deletion check to allow for easier cleanup of test data.

3.  **Systematic Testing:**
    *   Conducted a step-by-step test of the new Mise en Place workflow, from creating dishes and components to verifying their appearance on the kitchen checklist, which confirmed the new logic is working correctly.

## Next Steps & Open Tasks

1.  **Re-enable Component Deletion Check:**
    *   The protection that prevents admins from deleting a component that is currently used in a dish needs to be re-enabled and potentially refined to be more user-friendly.

2.  **Verify the "Connected Loop":**
    *   Now that the UI and data models are stable, we need to perform a full end-to-end test. Confirm that when an item's stock drops below its minimum level (e.g., after completing a Mise en Place task), it correctly appears on the "Low-Stock Items" screen and triggers the ordering suggestion workflow.

3.  **Improve Error Notification:**
    *   Design a more intuitive and effective way to notify staff of critical issues like insufficient stock, moving beyond the temporary `SnackBar`.

4.  **General UI/UX Polish:**
    *   Continue to address minor UI bugs and improve the overall user experience across the application.
