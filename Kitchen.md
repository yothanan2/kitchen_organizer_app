# Project Handoff: Kitchen Organizer

## Session Summary

This was a highly productive session focused on fixing deep-seated issues with the repository, connecting the core application logic, and fixing numerous critical bugs that were blocking progress.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Git Repository Cleanup:**
    *   Diagnosed that the repository's large size was due to previously committed build artifacts and other large files.
    *   Used `git-filter-repo` to completely remove these large files from the entire Git history, reducing the repository size from over 400MB to a manageable level.
    *   Successfully force-pushed the cleaned history to the remote, resolving all `git push` timeout errors.

2.  **Mise en Place & Inventory Integration:**
    *   Implemented the primary logic to connect the Mise en Place checklist to the inventory system. When a task is checked off, the required ingredients are now deducted from inventory.
    *   **Data Integrity:** Fixed a critical bug that allowed inventory to go into negative numbers. This was solved at both the application level (with an error message for the user) and the database level (with Firestore security rules) to guarantee data integrity.

3.  **Critical Bug Fixes & UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   **Missing "Quantity on Hand":** Added the missing "Quantity on Hand" field to the "Add/Edit Item" screen, which was a major blocker for proper inventory management.
    *   **"Unnamed Component" Bug:** Resolved a data consistency bug that caused components to appear as "Unnamed" in various screens.
    *   **State Loss on Edit Screen:** Fixed a frustrating bug where the component name would disappear after adding an ingredient.
    *   **Low-Stock Screen Refactor:** Overhauled the "Low-Stock Items" screen to group items by supplier and added a search bar, significantly improving its usability.
    *   **Feature Removal:** Cleaned up the codebase by removing the old "Today's Preps" feature, which is now redundant.

## Next Steps & Open Tasks

1.  **Final Git Commit (CRITICAL):**
    *   My environment is unable to execute the `git commit` command reliably. All the necessary files **have been staged**.
    *   **Immediate next action:** You need to run the following command in your terminal to finalize the session's work:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "feat: Integrate Mise en Place with inventory and fix critical bugs"
        ```
    *   After committing, run `git push` to back up the work.

2.  **Resolve RenderFlex Overflow (High Priority):**
    *   The visual overflow bug on the `InventoryOverviewScreen` is still present. This needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure the UI is stable.

3.  **Verify the "Connected Loop":**
    *   Now that the inventory and permission issues are resolved, the full workflow needs to be tested. Confirm that when an item's stock drops below its minimum level, it correctly appears on the "Low-Stock Items" screen.

4.  **Improve Error Notification:**
    *   We removed the persistent error log from the Mise en Place screen. The next step is to design a more intuitive and effective way to notify staff of critical issues like insufficient stock, moving beyond a simple `SnackBar`.
